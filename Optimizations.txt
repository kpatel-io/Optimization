Changes made to optimize performance:


Deault partitions are 200

questionsDF.rdd.getNumPartitions()=4

answers_month.rdd.getNumPartitions()=200

To avoid more shuffles in the join step,  reduced the no. of partitions using coalesce and set the same no. of partitions for both dataframes in the join condition 

answers_month=answers_month.coalesce(4)

resultDF = questionsDF.join(answers_month, 'question_id').select('question_id', 'title', 'month', 'cnt')

Removal of column 'creation_date' in the select step and noticed an improvement in performance
